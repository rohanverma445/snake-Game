Snake Game
A classic Snake game implemented in Java, designed to provide a simple yet engaging gaming experience. This project is a great way to explore the basics of Java programming, graphical user interfaces (GUIs), and game development principles.

Features
Classic Gameplay: Navigate the snake to eat food and grow longer without colliding with the walls or itself.
Simple Controls: Use arrow keys to control the snake's direction.
Scoring System: Keep track of the player's score, which increases as the snake eats more food.
Game Over Detection: The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or its own body.
